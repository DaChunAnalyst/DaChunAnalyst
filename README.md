- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaChunAnalyst. An Economics graduate looking to deep dive into data which is something I like to look at. I want to create my own project and hopefully work some some of you guys on this platform.
- 👀 I’m interested in Research and Data Analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, and Tableau.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on my own but hopefully collaborate with Alex The Analyst soon.
- 📫 Still setting up this page; however, I will upload my contact info soon.
